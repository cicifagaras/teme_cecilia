        <p>The Rottweiler is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large or large.<br />
            The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil<br />
            butchers' dogs, because their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts laden<br />
            with butchered meat to market. This continued until the mid-19th century when<br />
            railways replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many parts<br />
            of the world, Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs,<br />
            guard dogs, and police dogs.
